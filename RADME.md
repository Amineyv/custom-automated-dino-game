# custom-automated-dino-game

This is an automation program to play a custom dino game.

Recently, one of the biggest shopping companies in Iran created a gamification project in which you had to play as a dinasour and control it to jump over the obstacles and avoid birds to reach a maximum goal.

So I started to write a code that does this automatically for me.

I started by trying to hack chrome dino game.

Then I extended the code and used colors to detect the fences inside the new dino game.

The game is not available now. And because of some reasons I will not put the name of the company online.

I just uploaded the game so that you can use for other future games.

I myself scored for 799/1000 and won a 70% promo code from the website and bought my girlfriend an astonishing dress.
